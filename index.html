    const message = `*Ya Salaam, grant us ease on that Day*

This dua invokes Allah ﷻ by His Names Ar-Raheem (The Most Merciful) and As-Salaam (The Source of Peace and Safety), seeking ease, comfort, and joy on the Day of Judgment. It asks for shade beneath His Arsh (Throne) and reunion with loved ones in everlasting peace.

Because the mercy and peace of Allah transform the greatest trials into moments of divine tranquility.

As Allah ﷻ says:

As for those who believe and do good, the Most Compassionate will ˹certainly˺ bless them with ˹genuine˺ love.
(Qur’an 19:96)

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Raheem (O Most Merciful), Ya Salaam (O Source of Peace and Safety), make the Day of Judgment a day of comfort, ease, and joy for us. Grant us shade under Your Arsh (Throne) and reunite us with our loved ones in peace and happiness. When we approach the Sirat (Bridge), let us cross it with ease, in the blink of an eye.*
